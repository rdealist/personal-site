description: Hierarchical bullet lists for quick scanning

## List Types
- Use dashes (-) for unordered information at all nesting levels
- Use numbers (1., 2., 3.) for sequential steps
- Don't mix ordered/unordered at same level

## Hierarchy
- Main topic (top level)
  - Supporting info (nested)
    - Specific details (further nested)
- Each level elaborates its parent

## When to Use Ordered Lists
1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Sequential processes
3. Ranked/prioritized items
4. Chronological events

## Formatting Rules
- Mark action items with "ACTION:" or "TODO:"
- Keep each bullet concise (1-2 lines max)
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces per level)
- Group related info under logical parent bullets

## Code and Technical Info
- Show code snippets as separate blocks after relevant bullets
- Use bullets to explain what code does
- Break complex concepts into smaller bullets

## Task Completion Format
- Summary of completed work
  - Specific files modified
  - Key changes made
- Issues or caveats found
- Action items if applicable
